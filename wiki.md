This page is dedicated to prove why *mangos* are the **superior** fruit compared to any other option. Here you'll be given some history and nutritional facts.


## History of the Mango
With roots reaching back over 5,000 years, the mango boasts a rich history that began in the Indo-Burma region of Southeast Asia.  Cultivated by ancient civilizations, references to the fruit appear in Hindu writings as early as 4000 BC. Even revered as sacred, the mango tree is said to have provided shade for the meditating Buddha.  Traveling alongside humans, mango seeds embarked on a journey around 300-400 AD, reaching the Middle East, East Africa, and South America.  The Portuguese, arriving in India in 1498, became the first to establish a formal mango trade, further spreading the fruit's fame.  Spanish explorers then introduced mangoes to the Americas in the 1600s, solidifying the mango's place as a beloved fruit around the world.

## Nutritional Facts
Despite their undeniably sweet taste, mangoes are surprisingly low in calories. A single serving of mango (around 3/4 cup of sliced fruit) clocks in at only around 70 calories, making it a guilt-free way to satisfy your sweet tooth. But mangoes are more than just a delicious treat â€“ they're nutritional powerhouses. Packed with vitamin C, a single serving provides a whopping 75% of your daily recommended intake, which is essential for a healthy immune system and helps your body produce disease-fighting white blood cells.
### Fiber Powerhouse
The same serving size offers around 7% of your daily fiber needs, aiding digestion and promoting gut health.
### Packed with Vitamins and Minerals
Mangoes are a good source of other essential vitamins and minerals, including Vitamin A (important for healthy vision and immunity), Vitamin B6 (needed for energy metabolism), folate (crucial for cell growth and DNA repair), and potassium (which helps regulate blood pressure).

## Cultural Significance
In Vietnamese culture, the mango is more than just a delicious summer fruit. It's a symbol of prosperity, happiness, and a promising future. This vibrant fruit, with its sweet aroma and bright yellow flesh, is often presented as a gift during special occasions like weddings and Tet, the Vietnamese New Year.  While not always part of the traditional five-fruit tray, mangoes from southern Vietnam are increasingly included for their auspicious connotations.  The color and fragrance of the mango evoke positive sentiments and warm wishes, making it a delightful way to share good fortune with loved ones.  Even specific regions, like Khanh Hoa, are known for their mango cultivation, further solidifying the fruit's importance within Vietnamese culture.
